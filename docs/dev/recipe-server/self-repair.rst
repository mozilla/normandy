Self-Repair Protocol
====================
The following section describes how Firefox retrieves and executes recipes from
Normandy via the self-repair iframe.

When Firefox is launched by a user, it makes the following series of requests:

1. First, a ``GET`` request to ``https://self-repair.mozilla.org/en-US/repair``.
   The ``en-US`` part of the URL differs depending on the locale that Firefox
   was built for.

   The server returns an HTML page that loads the JavaScript for the self-repair
   shim. This JavaScript triggers and processes all other requests in the
   sequence.

2. Next, a ``POST`` to ``https://self-repair.mozilla.org/api/v1/fetch_bundle/``.
   This request includes client info, such as the client's update channel, and
   the response contains a list of recipes that should be run on the client.

3. Finally, a series of ``GET`` requests to URLs like
   ``https://self-repair.mozilla.org/api/v1/action/action-name/implementation/SHA1_HASH/``
   are sent to fetch the JavaScript code for each action to be executed. The
   ``SHA1_HASH`` part of the URL unsurprisingly contains a SHA1 hash of the
   JavaScript code being fetched.

.. http:get:: /(str:locale)/repair

   Returns an HTML page that performs the rest of the self-repair dance for
   fetching and executing recipes.

   :param string locale:
      Locale code for the Firefox client in use.
   :query boolean testing:
      If included, activates "testing mode", which alters the behavior of some
      recipes to make testing easier.

.. http:post:: /api/v1/fetch_bundle/

   Retrieves recipes that should be executed by the client based on filtering
   rules specified in the Normandy admin interface.

   :<json string locale:
      Locale code for the Firefox client in use.
   :<json string version:
      The client's Firefox version.
   :<json string release_channel:
      The release channel Firefox is currently set to.
   :<json string user_id:
      A v4 UUID used to provide stable sampling. If a recipe is sampled at 10%,
      this UUID helps ensure the same 10% of users consistently receive that
      recipe.

   :>json string country:
      Geolocated country code for the client based on their IP address.
   :>json array recipes:
      List of recipes that have been matched to the user.

   **Example response**:

   .. sourcecode:: json

      {
         "country": "US",
         "recipes": [
            {

                  "arguments_schema": {
                     "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",

                           "type": "string",
                        }
                     },
                     "required": [
                        "message"
                     ],

               },

                  "message": "It works!"
               }
            }
         ]
      }

.. http:get:: /api/v1/action/(string:action_name)/implementation/(string:action_hash)/

   Retreives the JavaScript code for executing an action.

   :param string action_name:
      Unique slug for the action being requested.
   :param string action_hash:
      SHA1 hash of the action code being requested.
   :status 200:
      When the action code is found and the hash matches it.
   :status 404:
      If no action could be found with the given ``action_name``, or if the
      given ``action_hash`` does not match the stored JavaScript.
