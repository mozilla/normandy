Developer Setup
===============
The following describes how to set up an instance of the site on your
computer for development.

Prerequisites
-------------
This guide assumes you have already installed and set up the following:

1. Git_
2. `Python 3.6`_, `pip 8`_ or higher, and virtualenv_
3. `Node.js 8`_ and NPM 5.
4. `Postgres 9.4`_
5. ``openssl``

These docs assume a Unix-like operating system, although the site should, in
theory, run on Windows as well. All the example commands given below are
intended to be run in a terminal.

.. _Git: https://git-scm.com/
.. _Python 3.6: https://www.python.org/
.. _pip 8: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/
.. _Node.js 8: https://nodejs.org/en/
.. _virtualenv: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/
.. _Postgres 9.4: http://www.postgresql.org/

Installation
------------
1. Clone this repository or your fork_:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/mozilla/normandy.git
      cd normandy

2. Create a virtualenv for Normandy and activate it:

   .. code-block:: bash

      virtualenv venv
      source ./venv/bin/activate

   .. note::

      Whenever you want to work on Normandy in a new terminal you'll have to
      re-activate the virtualenv. Read the virtualenv_ documentation to learn
      more about how virtualenv works.

3. Install the dependencies using pip:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install -r requirements/default.txt -c requirements/constraints.txt

   .. seealso::

      :ref:`pip-install-error`
         How to troubleshoot errors during ``pip install``.

4. Install frontend dependencies using yarn_
   and build the frontend code using npm:

   .. code-block:: bash

      yarn install
      npm run build

.. _yarn: https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/

5. Create a Postgres database for Normandy. By default it is assumed to be named
   ``normandy``:

   .. code-block:: bash

      createdb normandy

   .. note::

      By default, it will connect to ``localhost`` using the global ``postgres``
      user. If you use a different name for the database, or otherwise want to
      customize how you connect to the database, you may specify the database
      URL by adding the following to a ``.env`` file at the root of the repo:

      .. code-block:: ini

         DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@server_addr/database_name


6. Initialize your database by running the migrations:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python manage.py migrate

7. Create a new superuser account:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python manage.py createsuperuser

8. Pull the latest geolocation database using the ``download_geolite2.sh``
   script:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ./bin/download_geolite2.sh

9. Load actions into the database:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python manage.py update_actions

10. Update product details:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python manage.py update_product_details

11. Load in initial data:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python manage.py initial_data

Once you've finished these steps, you should be able to start the site by
running:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./bin/runsslserver.sh

.. note::

   The ``runsslserver.sh`` command automatically creates a self-signed
   certificate in the ``etc/ssl`` directory of the repository. When viewing the
   site for the first time, you will have to create a certificate exception to
   allow Firefox to accept the certificate and access the site over HTTPS.

The site should be available at https://localhost:8000/.

Autograph
---------
If you want to execute recipes on your local instance using the recipe
client, you'll need to set up Autograph_ to sign recipes as you save them:

1. Follow the `Autograph installation instructions`_ to launch a development
   instance of Autograph.

2. Add the following configuration to ``.env`` (create the file
   if it does not exist yet):

   .. code-block:: ini

      DJANGO_AUTOGRAPH_URL=http://localhost:8765/
      DJANGO_AUTOGRAPH_HAWK_ID=normandev
      DJANGO_AUTOGRAPH_HAWK_SECRET_KEY=3dhoaupudifjjvm7xznd9bn73159xn3xwr77b61kzdjwzzsjts

With the configuration in place, you should see log messages when saving recipes
that look like this::

   INFO 2017-05-01 19:58:04,274 normandy.recipes.models Requesting signatures for recipes with ids [16] from Autograph
   INFO 2017-05-01 19:58:04,301 normandy.recipes.utils Got 1 signatures from Autograph

Therapist
---------
If you want to automatically enforce Normandy code style guidelines, you can
use the `Therapist`_ pre-commit hook. To install Therapist, simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

      pip install therapist

After that, you should be able to run
the following to set up the git pre-commit hook:

.. code-block:: bash

      therapist install

After that, whenever you make a new commit Therapist will check the changed
code. This will save time when submitting pull requests.

If you ever need to bypass Therapist, you can do so by passing
``--no-verify`` to your ``git commit`` command.
