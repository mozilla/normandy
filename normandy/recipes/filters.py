"""
Filter objects are based on a series of simple rules. In order for a recipe to
match a user, every part of a filter object must be true. In other words, the
parts of a filter expression are ``AND``ed together.

Each filter below defines a rule, and when it matches a user. Filter parameters
are represented as JSON. Most users will interact with filters are a higher
level, such as a web interface that allows building a filter with a form.
