# Addon Builder

This is the base image for Taskcluster jobs that build recipe-client-addon. It
is not currently built in any automation, and must be manually updated if
changes are made.

It's primary purpose is to install the packages needed to succesfully build
recipe-client-addon and mozilla-central. It's canonical image name is
mozilla/normandy-taskcluster.
