# Normandy

Normandy is a collection of projects that provide a fast and accurate way to
interact with unbiased subsets of Firefox users.

This repo is a *monorepo*. It contains several projects, each represented by a
top level directory:

* recipe-server - Django server that manages and delivers recipes
  efficiently and securely.
* recipe-client-addon - Firefox system add-on to fetch, verify, and execute
  recipes.
* lints - Shared tools and configs for linting. (Each project may have separate
  configs as well)
* compose - Scripts and configurations to create multi-server environments for
  development and testing.
* mozjexl - A safe expression evaluation library. A fork of [Jexl][].
